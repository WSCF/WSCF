# 0.7 (BETA)
Converted to Visual Studio 2017, VSIX v3.

# 0.6 (BETA)
This build is the first functional build for the WSCF.blue Visual Studio Extension.  The Contact class in the ContactFirst assembly was refactored to 
decouple the Visual Studio code and contract generation from the Add-in and Extension specific implementations.  The WSCF.blue functionality remains
the same but is now cleanly separated from the implementation.
